# keycloak-login-custom-captcha

By default Keycloak ( up to 4.4.0) only supports ReCaptcha for Regsitration, not login.  raptor-group have created a keycloak-login-recaptcha project for enabling recaptcha on login also. But, what if you don't want to use recaptcha for some reasons. You can have your own captcha mechanism with this project.
